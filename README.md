In this Project we're creating a web application for CDC Telkom Witel Surabaya Partner's data and file inventory before update it to the central/corporate application since the central/corporate application doesn't have storing file feature.

##### The tech we're using is: 
- Laravel Framework
- MySQL for Database

##### Feature in this application
- Storing record of data and file manually
- Storing record of data at once by importing CSV file
- Delete entire file of partners if the partners data are deleted
- SuperAdmin to create and delete admin account

##### Feature that needs to be updated
- Alert message when importing CSV file are failed (Kode Mitra need to be 11 Digits)
- Alert and make the application unable to receive file other than Image and PDF files
- Add edit password feature in superadmin
- creating folder based on partners for storing file not included in the same folder for all partners
